## Abstract
  - "Travel Tracker" is a mock-up site which allows a user to keep track of trips they've taken, how much they've spent on travel, and also allows them to request new trips (which appear on the site with a "pending" stamp). This project was an opportunity to bring together all of the major concepts I've been practicing over the last few weeks, including using Test-Driven Development, working with an API and making fetch requests to and from a server, practicing accessible design, utilizing SASS, and learning new NPM packages.

## Installation and Setup:
**To navigate the website live, a server download is required.**
  1. Follow the instructions to download and install the API [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api)
  2. Once you've installed the API, run the server with `npm start`
  3. You'll need to keep the API running, so open a new terminal tab!

**Now, get Travel Tracker running:**
  1. Clone down this repo: <br>
      `git clone https://github.com/NEwertKrocker/travel-tracker`
  2. Install the necessary package dependencies - <br>
      `npm install`
  3. Run the server with `npm start`
  4. With both the server running and this package, visit `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser.
  5. To log in, use a username from `traveler1` to `traveler50` with the password `travel`.

## Wins
  - While building this site, I really felt like several of my skills were coalescing. I was able to build the HTML and CSS (in SASS) without much trouble, and the JavaScript likewise. Even fetch calls went off without a hitch!

## Challenges + Improvements
  - I didn't run into any major challenges in this project, but thus far this mock-up is only for a traveler, not a travel agent -- I would love to implement an "admin" account type that could approve and delete trips as is laid out in the spec.
